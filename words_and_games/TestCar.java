// In this assignment you need to develop a class named yourlastname_Car with the following attributes: 
// model, year, color, mileage.  It should also have the following methods: a default constructor, 
// set and get methods for each of the attributes, and a toString method that prints out the Car information in any format you choose.  
// This code should go into a yourlastname_Car.java file.
//
// Then you need to develop a class with a main method to test your Car class, name it yourlastname_TestCar.java.  
// It will create one or more objects of the class Car and test all the methods.  Please refer to the 
// Student class example given in this week's module to do this assignment.  
// Note: You may add other attributes and methods if you would like, just be sure you test everything in your Car class in your main. 
//
// Extra Credit: For 5 points of extra credit, add a static member variable to your class and a static method to access it.  
// Test this method from your test program.
